The CSS specificity rules can sometimes lead to unexpected results when multiple selectors target the same element.  For example, consider this scenario:

```css
div p { color: blue; }
.special p { color: red; }
```

If you have an element like this:

```html
<div class="special">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```

The text will be red, because the selector `.special p` is more specific than `div p`. However, understanding and debugging these specificity issues can be tricky.  Another example is accidentally overriding styles due to the cascade, where a later style rule might unintentionally overwrite a previous one.
